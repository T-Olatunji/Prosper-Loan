# (Prosper Loan Data Exploration)
## by (Olatunji Titobiloluwa)


## Prosper Loan Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. There are three ordered categorical variables namely : Prosper Ratings, Prosper Score and Employment Status.


## Summary of Findings

> In the exploration, I found out that there is a negative correlation between BorrowerRate and LoanOriginalAmount which disagrees with my hypothesis: the higher the loan amount, the higher the interest rate. From the plot, it shows that the higher the loan amount, the lower the interest rate. Also, I found out that there is a positive correlation between StatedMonthlyIncome and LoanOriginalAmount which makes sense because borrowers with higher income get to loan high amount of money. Another variable that has effect on Loan Amount and Borrower Rate is the Prosper Ratings.The BorrowerRate decreases with better ratings. Borrowers with the best ratings have the lowest interest rate. This shows that Prosper Ratings has a strong effect on Borrower's interest rate.Also,Loan Amount increases with better ratings. Borrowers with high stated monthly income also have good prosper ratings. A surprising and interesting interaction is that the BorrowerRate and OriginalLoanAmount is negatively correlated when the Prosper ratings are from HR to B, but the correlation is shifted over to be positive when the ratings are A and AA.
Also, most borrowers that are employed, full-time or self employed tend to have more income and loan amounts than retired, part time, not available and not employed borrowers. 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I will just focus on the features that have major effect on a Borrower's interest Rate which are Original Loan Amount and Prosper Ratings. I will start by showing the distribution of Borrower's Rate and Loan Amount. Then, I will show the relationship between the Rate and the Loan Amount as well as the relationship between Rate and Prosper Ratings. I will explain the effects of Rate vs Loan Amount and Rate vs  Prosper Ratings.
